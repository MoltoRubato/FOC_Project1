# FOC Questions Repository  

## Overview  
This repository contains solutions to four data science questions focused on time series analysis and wastewater management, inspired by real-world applications.  

### Questions Covered  
1. **Pump Operations**: Determine how many times a wastewater pump operates given inflow data and tank capacity.  
2. **Flow Volatility**: Measure the volatility of inflows to optimize wastewater treatment efficiency.  
3. **Next Flow Prediction**: Predict the next inflow value using time series similarity.  
4. **Load Balancing**: Minimize volatility in combined wastewater inflows by delaying flows.  

## Technologies  
- Python  

## How to Use  
Clone the repository and navigate to individual question folders for code and documentation:  
```bash
